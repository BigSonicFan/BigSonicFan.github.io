When I was younger, I used to make what I call "Paper Characters". They were like dolls out of paper. They were a lot of fun to make back at the time. Surprisingly, I still have a few of them left.</td>

I have been making plushies for almost 3 years. While some use a sewing machine to sew things, I do hand-stitching, which adds a little more love into creations in my opinion.</td>

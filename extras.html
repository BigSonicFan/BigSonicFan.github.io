	<h1>Extras?</h1>
	<p>This is more about the school I been going to, classes I'm taken, and more.</p>
	<h3>What School am I at right now?</h3>
	<p>Well, right now, I'm still going to OTC. Once I used up my time in that school, I'll probably take some classes in Drury, and/or MSU. It will be a big change for me once that happens. But, like always, it had to be tolerated somehow.</p>
	<h3>What are you going to school for?</h3>
	<p>At this time, I'm going for is Computer Science and Game Development. (As long as I keep all of my other talents, I'm good.)</p>
	<h3>What Classes have I taken?</h3>
		<h4>Here are the classes I taken so far.</h4>

			<h3>What have you learned throughout this semester you have taken?</h3>
			<p>Other than Calculus 2 stuff, I did learn some things in Web Site Development this semester. I have tried to take the Web Site Development class last semester, but I had to drop-out because of stress-related reasons. However, I did learn a bit more when retaking this class. I have learned the basics last semester, which this semester, some things that were familiar before became more understanding to me.</p>
			<table class="listHeading">
			<tr>
				<th class="listHeading listHead" colspan="2">Things I Learned This Semester</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">index.html</td>
				<td class="list">A proper name for your primary file. Extras files connected to and work like the index file can have any name as long as they have no spaces in between. (No Spaces Allowed!)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">< div ></td>
				<td class="list">I learned that you can put the codes into groups with this code.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">< style ></td>
				<td class="list">This code works exactly like the file styles.css. So, there are 2 ways to add style to your page. (No pun intended.)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list"><p>< table > < tr ></p><p>< th > < td ></p></td>
				<td class="list">Do you wonder how tables are made? Well, I got to learn it with these codes! I learned that table is the entire table, tr is the row, th is the amount of rows, and td is consider what's below th. I also learned that you can adjust the amount of rows and columns by using rowspan/colspan, and have it set to a certain number. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">class and id</td>
				<td class="list">Codes can share the same class names, and they can share as many class names as they you want. With id names, it can only be used for one code only. It's for if you want something to be in a specific way.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">@media</td>
				<td class="list">You can change sizes with the @media code, and set specific height and/or width on images, and texts sizes for other devices.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">Proper Indenting</td>
				<td class="list">Indenting your codes properly is important. It keeps things organized, and makes your progress easier.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">Zipping the Folder</td>
				<td class="list">Last semester I took that class, zipping the folder was really hard and confusing. Now, zipping the folder made a lot more sense to me!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">Making Websites Live</td>
				<td class="list">I got to learn how to make a website live with a little help of FileZilla.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">Font Awesome</td>
				<td class="list">There's even a website called Font Awesome. You can find very interesting icons to put on your website.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list">Bootstrap</td>
				<td class="list">Bootstrap where it has more features to make your websites look more professional with cards, carousel, different styles of buttons you can use, and more!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td class="list"><h6>VALIDATE!!!</h6></td>
				<td class="list"><h6>VALIDATE!!! IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO VALIDATE!</h6>(Don't mind the big caps. That's just a way to tell you how important validating is, that's all.)</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>(And, I also learned that my teachers love the cookies I gave her this semester. I thought I throw that out there.)</p>
			<h3>What classes are you hoping to take in the future?</h3>
			<p>Well, I know that I will be taking two classes next semester, being Calculus 3, and Web Site Development 2. After them, I am not sure which classes I'm taking in the next semester.</p>
			<h3>What is your Graduation Date?</h3>
			<p>To be honest... I am not sure. All I know is that I'll be in college for awhile. How long will that be? Well, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

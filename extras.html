	<h1>Hobbies?</h1>
		<p>I have made an assignment related to my hobbies a couple times. But, I'll be happy to tell you about them again. Unless, this is your first time reading them...? I'm cool either way.</p>
		<table class="hobbies">
			<tr class="stuff">
				<td><h3>Art</h3></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I'm very open minded when it comes to art. However, if you do wonder what I meant by "art", I love to draw, paint, sculpt with clay, and make crafts. When I was younger, I used to make what I call "Paper Characters" Surprisingly, I still have a few of them left.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="stuff">
				<td><h3>Video Games</h3></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I got into video games when I was younger thanks to my sister. I don't have a specific favorite genre of video games because I honestly love a variety of them. My most favorites would be the games from the franchises I grew up with.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr class="stuff">
				<td><h3>Sewing Crafts</h3></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>One of the hobbies I wanted to get into since I was younger. It was until 2017 where I start sewing things. Honestly, it was because I wanted to make my very own plushies, also known as stuffed animals. I have made a few plushies with my sewing skills for 2 years. While some use a sewing machine to sew things, I do hand-stitching, which adds a little more love into creations in my opinion.</td>
